# Employee Hero

Employee Hero is an HR Tool that allows an employees to learn more about their co-workers. The software lets organizations ask customized questions to their employees, while employees can answer questions and view answers their co-workers have given. The goal of the software is to provide more of an introduction to a colleague's background then you might normally have the chance to get (especially so in a remote work environment!)

## Next Steps

1. **Employee to Employee Communication:** Allowing co-workers to comment on each others answers or ask each other questions directly could improve the use case of the application.

2. **Answering Profile Questions:** When a user initially signs in, they should be able to answer all question using one submit button, as opposed to having to answer each question separately like they do in the current version.

3. **Delete Employees:** An Admin Employee should be able to delete employees who are no longer with the organization.

4. **Profile Picture:** Allowing a user to upload a profile picture would help improve the applications interface.
